# Hello, Athena!

This is the code project for the [Hello, Athena!](https://davidpallmann.hashnode.dev/hello-athena) blog post. 

This episode: Amazon Athena. In this [Hello, Cloud](https://davidpallmann.hashnode.dev/series/hello-cloud) blog series, we're covering the basics of AWS cloud services for newcomers who are .NET developers. If you love C# but are new to AWS, or to this particular service, this should give you a jumpstart.

In this post we'll introduce Amazon Athena and the concept of data lakes, create a "Hello, Cloud" use of Athena, and use it in a .NET program. We'll do this step-by-step, making no assumptions other than familiarity with C# and Visual Studio. We're using Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 6.

## Our Hello, Athena Project

Weâ€™re going to create a data lake and upload expense report CSV files to it. Next, we'll teach Athena to understand the data and query the data from the AWS console. Finally, we'll create a .NET console program that queries the data with Athena via the AWS SDK for .NET. 

See the blog post for the tutorial to create this project and run it on AWS.
